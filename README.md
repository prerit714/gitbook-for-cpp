# My guide for revising/learning c++ as a gitbook

## How to use this gitbook?
Each git commit will have executable code about a certain c++ topic

## Why a _vimrc file?
I really love using vim that's why. But the real reason is custom build commands that can be used if you are using vim as well (gVim to be specific)

## Compile and Run
Just type :CppBuild for a build version or type :CppDebug for a debug mode executable
